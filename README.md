I lived in Toronto, CANADA. I am intrested in find more about the places and streets.  I would like to analyse and check its need any corrections or improvements.

1. When I audit the data for the Street and found that some of the street name abbreviation are not what we expected. I able to improve or update the Stree name abbreviation to the expected name.
  
   * 'Rd.' -> Road
   * 'st'  -> Street
   * 'Ter' -> Terrace


2. When I audit the Postal Code, some of them are missing a space as follows 'L1W3R2'. 
   * The right format is :'L1W 3R2'.
